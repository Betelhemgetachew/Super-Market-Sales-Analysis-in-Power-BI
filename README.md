# Super-Market-Sales-Analysis-in-Power-BI


## Project Overview
This project analyzes supermarket sales data from three branches between January and March 2019. Using Power BI, we explore customer demographics, branch performance, product line analysis, customer behavior, and time-based sales trends. The analysis offers insights into sales patterns and provides recommendations for improving business performance.

## Key Objectives
1. **Data Importation**: Loading the dataset into Power BI from a CSV file.
2. **Data Exploration**: Uncover key sales patterns, such as branch-wise customer counts, gender distribution, and product line performance.
3. **Branch Performance Analysis**: Visualizing sales, market share, and income distribution across the three branches.
4. **Product Line Analysis**: Identifying top-grossing and most popular product lines, and comparing their performance across categories.
5. **Customer Behavior**: Analyzing customer behavior based on gender, membership status, payment method preferences, and average ratings.
6. **Time-Based Sales Trends**: Exploring hourly sales trends to pinpoint peak shopping hours and provide recommendations for handling customer traffic.
7. **City Analysis**: Comparing sales performance and customer ratings across different cities.
8. **Conclusion & Recommendations**: Summarizing findings and providing strategic recommendations for improving sales, customer experience, and branch performance.
